            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>My name is Esther Adegoke, and I joined Altschool in September 2023. My journey to Altschool is quite interesting as I had applied to The School of Engineering earlier in the year but I couldn't complete due to no funds. I reapplied later in the year and I was able to secure a 50% scholarship to learn at Altschool. I have no prior background in programming nor computer science. My background was in politics, music and content writing. However, I love <strong>problem solving</strong> and <strong>Maths</strong> so much that I would randomly look up quizes online. I found out I could keep providing solutions to problems through programming and after researching how I could start, I found <strong>Altschool</strong>.</p>

            <h2>Why Alschool?</h2>
            <p>Great section to continue! After doing so much research, I found Altschool. I was however, still worried that I had to have a background in computer science. I reached out to some of the Alumnus and I found out I could start without any background in computer science. Upon further research, I found out the many opportunities that Altschool would offer a newbie like me. I also loved that Altschool was an international learning citadel and I have always loved to school in an international system. I just knew Alschool was the right place and I wasted no time! I'm happy with my experience so far and I can't wait for the many more things I'm set to learn and experience witH Altschool</p>
